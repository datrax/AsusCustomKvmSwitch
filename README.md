Asus Custom Kvm Switch

KVM software for Windows that sends video signal switch to the ASUS monitor when detects that the USB hub was connected or disconnected. 
Tested with ASUS ROG Swift PG38UQ. 
Note - ASUS didn't implement HDMI2 in their VCP, only HDMI1 and Displayport are supported. 
Select 0x11 to switch to HDMI1 and 0x13 for Displayport.
